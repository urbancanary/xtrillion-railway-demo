The Mexican president-elect is Claudia Sheinbaum, who is projected to become the first female president of Mexico
Sheinbaum, a candidate from the ruling Morena party, achieved a significant victory in the recent elections, receiving between 58.3% and 60.7% of the vote according to preliminary results from the National Electoral Institute (INE)
Her main rival, Xóchitl Gálvez from the opposition coalition, garnered between 26.6% and 28.6% of the vote.
Claudia Sheinbaum has a notable background as a former head of government of Mexico City and has degrees in physics and energy engineering
She has been involved in politics since 2000, serving in various capacities, including as Secretary of the Environment under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s administration
Sheinbaum is recognized for her expertise in climate science and has emphasized her commitment to governing all Mexicans “without distinction,” aiming to address the diverse needs of the population.
Sheinbaum will officially take office on October 1, and her term will last six years
Outgoing President López Obrador, who is also her political mentor, has stated he will not influence her decisions regarding her administration and has expressed his satisfaction with handing over the presidency to a woman after 200 years of male leadership in Mexico.
The election was historic not only because of Sheinbaum's gender but also because it was the largest election in Mexico's history, with over 98 million registered voters and more than 20,000 positions contested
Despite the significant electoral turnout, the elections were marred by violence, with numerous political killings preceding the vote.
Claudia Sheinbaum faces several challenges as she prepares to take office, including issues related to security, organized crime, energy policy, and immigration
Her administration's approach to these complex issues will be closely watched, particularly in the context of the ongoing relationship between Mexico and the United States.
