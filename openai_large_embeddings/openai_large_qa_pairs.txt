Question: whats your view of us interest rates andy? Answer: I think the current economic climate suggests that the Federal Reserve should be more proactive in cutting interest rates. While the unemployment rate has declined to 4.2%, I believe this is a sign that the labor market might not be as robust as it appears. The deteriorating trends in employment are concerning, and if we want to support growth and combat any potential economic slowdown, more aggressive cuts could be warranted.
As for the rate cut in September, I feel it seems almost inevitable given the current data and Powell's comments. Monitoring inflation trends is crucial, and with base effects likely driving inflation down, there's a solid case for the Fed to act decisively. I really think it would benefit the economy if the Fed takes a bolder approach to interest rates in light of the evolving economic landscape. {#general #doc_20240911_181136}
