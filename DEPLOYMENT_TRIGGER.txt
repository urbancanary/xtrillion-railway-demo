Deployment Trigger File
=======================

This file is used to force Railway to redeploy when needed.

Last Update: 2025-08-06 08:15:00

Reason: Docker build failure - optimized Dockerfile for Railway environment

Recent Changes:
- Optimized Dockerfile to handle network issues with retry logic
- Changed from multi-stage to single-stage build
- Added retry logic for apt-get and pip install commands
- Updated .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
- Adjusted health check settings for Railway

Previous issues:
- Navigation not working on deployed version
- Docker build failing with network errors

If deployment still fails, check:
1. Railway build logs for specific errors
2. Network connectivity issues
3. Base image availability
