Deployment Trigger File
=======================

This file is used to force Railway to redeploy when needed.

Last Update: 2025-08-06 07:58:00

Reason: Navigation not working on deployed version, pages not changing.

Recent Changes:
- Added caching to improve performance
- Fixed navigation debugging
- Updated debug info to show real timestamps
- Added fallback navigation if st.navigation fails

If navigation still doesn't work after this deploy, check:
1. Streamlit version compatibility
2. st.navigation browser support
3. Railway environment variables
